# Journal Club

A straw poll during [#Polyglotconf](http://polyglotconf.com/) showed a lot of interest in attending a "Journal Club" to review interesting publications in the field.

## Things TBD:

  - how to nominate papers
  - format for meetings
  - dates, times
  - pretty much everything else

## Method for determining the above:

  - Send a pull request, discuss in issue comments
