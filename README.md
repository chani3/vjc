# Journal Club

A straw poll during [#Polyglotconf](http://polyglotconf.com/) showed a lot of interest in attending a "Journal Club" to review interesting publications in the field.

## Online Discussion

Alex Cruise helpfully set up a [G+ Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110886264051164890990) for this in lieu of massive Twitter hashtags.

## Initial Meetings

Offline face-to-face stuff solely at Polyglot beers for now, see the [main meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PolyglotVancouver/) for now.

## Things TBD:

  - how to nominate papers
  - format for meetings
  - dates, times
  - pretty much everything else

## Method for determining the above:

  - Send a pull request, discuss in issue comments

## Repo rules

We're going to apply the [Felix Hack](http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html). Submit a sane PR, you get commit access.
